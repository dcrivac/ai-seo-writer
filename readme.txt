A full-suite, multi-model content platform with an integrated SEO optimizer. Generate, refine, repurpose, and link articles with your choice of AI, all within a unique, themeable interface.

== Description ==

AI SEO Writer is a complete content workflow designed to dominate. It's more than a generator; it's a content strategy and automation suite that puts you in control.

Choose your weapon: leverage the power of **OpenAI's GPT-5** or **Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro & Flash models**. Our platform seamlessly integrates with the latest and greatest.

* **Single Post Mode:** Craft a perfect article, then use the integrated **SEO Analysis Suite** to optimize it with a live checklist and one-click fixes for meta descriptions and internal links.
* **Bulk Generator:** Unleash the power of bulk creation. Feed the plugin a list of keywords, choose your desired content length and format, and watch as it generates a queue of drafts.
* **Content Refinery:** Breathe new life into any post on your site. Select an article and instantly repurpose it into an email newsletter, a social media thread, a list of key takeaways, or even a video script outline.

This is the ultimate tool for scaling your content production, all wrapped in our signature "Tijuana After Midnight" dark-mode interface.

= Features =

* **Themeable Interface:** Choose between the "Tijuana After Midnight" dark theme or the minimalist "Wabi-Sabi" light theme.
* **Multi-Model Support:** Use OpenAI (GPT-5) or Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) API keys.
* **Integrated SEO Analysis Suite:** A live checklist with one-click optimizations for your focus keyword.
* **Advanced Bulk Generator:** Control content length and format (blog post, FAQ, etc.) for bulk tasks.
