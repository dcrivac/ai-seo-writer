A full-suite, multi-model content platform. Generate, refine, repurpose, and link articles with your choice of AI, all within a unique, dark-mode interface.

== Description ==

AI SEO Writer is a complete content workflow designed to dominate. It's more than a generator; it's a content strategy and automation suite that puts you in control.

Choose your weapon: leverage the power of **OpenAI's GPT models** or **Google's Gemini models**. Our platform seamlessly integrates with both.

* **Single Post Mode:** Craft a perfect article with advanced controls for tone and audience, then use the "Tijuana Tune-Up" panel to instantly generate SEO metadata, social teasers, and find internal linking opportunities with the AI-powered **SmartLink** feature.
* **Barracuda Bulk Mode:** Unleash the power of bulk creation. Feed the plugin a list of keywords and watch as it generates a queue of drafts using your default AI model.
* **Content Refinery:** Breathe new life into any post on your site. Select an article and instantly repurpose it into an email newsletter, a social media thread, a list of key takeaways, or even a video script outline.

This is the ultimate tool for scaling your content production, all wrapped in our signature "Tijuana After Midnight" dark-mode interface.
